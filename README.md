# Workout Website with Authentication

This Workout Wesite is a full-stack restful API application built with React. I used React Context to handle the user and workout information.
Registaring and SignIn Pages are built for this project as well. Json Web Token and salting password are also applied for authentication.
Error Handleing Message are shown on page when the input is wrong.
You can check demo for more detailed of this applcation.
